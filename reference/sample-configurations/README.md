Important: These assets aren't intended to be feature complete or fully compliant, but rather to help accelerate cloud migrations and cloud refactoring efforts by entities required to meet region- or industry-specific security requirements. While these assets can help you reduce the effort required to manually build a production-ready infrastructure, you will still need to tailor them to your unique business needs. For more information about how to use AWS in compliance with specific requirements, see [AWS Compliance Programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/). Consult with your AWS team to understand controls to meet your requirements.
