 * You may make multiple property changes in one of those configurations if necessary. Trying to modify properties in both configurations will result in a pipeline failure. This is due to the fact that

 * @remarks
 * FORWARD rules should be defined under an OUTBOUND {@link ResolverEndpointConfig}. SYSTEM rules

 *
 * The following example creates a forwarding rule for `example.com` that is shared with the
