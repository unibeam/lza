# Security Hub Findings

The Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS (LZA) solution includes a feature to enable AWS Security Hub, which provides a comprehensive view of the security state and helps you assess your environment against security standards and best practices. When deploying LZA, it is essential to review and address the Security Hub findings to ensure a secure environment based on your requirements. The following table provides guidance on AWS Security Hub findings that you may encounter during the deployment of LZA using sample configurations.

!!! note
    You should regularly review and monitor new findings in AWS Security Hub, as your environment and workloads evolve over time. This guidance applies to the resources created and managed by the Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS solution. For other findings in your environment, it is recommend to follow the [Security Hub controls reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-controls-reference.html).

These policies have conditions that restrict their usage to the LZA generated alias of KMS keys, ensuring that the decryption actions are performed only within the specific account and region. Additionally, the usage of these policies is restricted to solution created resources and protected by service control policies in the member accounts. Alternatively, you can choose to suppress the finding for these resources. |
| [KMS.2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/kms-controls.html#kms-2) | IAM principals should not have IAM inline policies that allow decryption actions on all KMS keys | Medium | When using the Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS solution, this finding includes the following AWS IAM principles with prefixes `{ACCELERATOR_PREFIX}`  and `{cdk-accel}`: <br><br> - `{ACCELERATOR_PREFIX}`-InstallerS-UpdatePipelineLambdaRoleXXXX (UpdatePipelineLambdaPolicy284ABC36) <br>- `{cdk-accel}`-file-publishing-role-211125696757-us-east-1 <br> - `{cdk-accel}`-deploy-role-211125696757-us-east-1 <br><br> You can disregard this finding related to AWS IAM principles with the prefix `{ACCELERATOR_PREFIX}`, as these roles with inline polices are managed by LZA to enable decryption operations on KMS keys. These policies are used by lambda functions created by the solution and performs decryption actions only within the specific account and region adhering to the principle of least privilege. <br><br> For the roles related to the AWS Cloud Developmental Kit (CDK), enabling the `useManagementAccessRole` option in the `global-config.yaml` file modifies CDK operations to use the IAM role specified in the `managementAccountAccessRole` option rather than the default roles created by CDK. The default CDK roles will still be created but will be only used for initial cdk resources setup. This finding  guidance is mentioned in the CDK [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/bootstrapping.html#bootstrapping-securityhub). Therefore, you can disregard those roles. <br><br> Alternatively, you can choose to suppress the finding for these resources. |
