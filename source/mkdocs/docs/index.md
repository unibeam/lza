# Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS

The Landing Zone Accelerator on AWS (LZA) is architected to align with AWS best practices
and in conformance with multiple, global compliance frameworks. We recommend customers
deploy AWS Control Tower as the foundational landing zone and enhance their landing zone
capabilities with Landing Zone Accelerator. These complementary capabilities provides a
comprehensive low-code solution across 35+ AWS services to manage and govern a multi-account
environment built to support customers with highly-regulated workloads and complex compliance
requirements. AWS Control Tower and Landing Zone Accelerator help you establish platform
readiness with security, compliance, and operational capabilities.

Landing Zone Accelerator is provided as an open-source project that is built using the AWS
Cloud Development Kit (CDK). You install directly into your environment to
get full access to the infrastructure as code (IaC) solution. Through a
simplified set of configuration files, you are able to configure additional
functionality, controls and security services (eg. AWS Managed Config Rules,
and AWS Security Hub), manage your foundational networking topology (eg. VPCs,
Transit Gateways, and Network Firewall), and generate additional workload
accounts using the AWS Control Tower Account Factory.

There are no additional charges or upfront commitments required to use Landing
Zone Accelerator on AWS. You pay only for AWS services enabled in order to set
up your platform and operate your controls. This solution can also support
non-standard AWS partitions, including AWS GovCloud (US), and the US Secret and
Top Secret regions.

!!! warning "Important"
    This solution will not, by itself, make you compliant. It provides
    the foundational infrastructure from which additional complementary solutions
    can be integrated. The information contained in this solution implementation
    guide is not exhaustive. You must be review, evaluate, assess, and approve the
    solution in compliance with your organizationâ€™s particular security features,
    tools, and configurations. It is the sole responsibility of you and your
    organization to determine which regulatory requirements are applicable and to
    ensure that you comply with all requirements. Although this solution discusses
    both the technical and administrative requirements, this solution does not help
    you comply with the non-technical administrative requirements.

!!! info "Anonymized data collection"
    This solution collects anonymized operational metrics to help AWS improve the
    quality of features of the solution. For more information, including how to
    disable this capability, please see the [implementation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/landing-zone-accelerator-on-aws/collection-of-operational-metrics.html).
