# Security FAQ

## What purpose do the breakGlassUsers in `reference/sample-configurations/lza-sample-config/iam-config.yaml` serve, and what do I do with them?

Break glass access is a [recommended best practice](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/break-glass-access.html) for gaining access to the organization management account or sub-accounts when there is a security incident or failure of the Identity Provider (IdP) infrastructure. [MFA](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/mfa/) and [password reset on next sign-in](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_CreateLoginProfile.html) policies are enforced for break glass users through the `iam-policies/boundary-policy.json` and `iam-config.yaml` settings. It is imperative for the organization management admin to register [MFA devices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/how-to-register-device.html) and reset the Landing Zone Accelerator generated passwords before they expire, per the `maxPasswordAge` ([https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAccountPasswordPolicy.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateAccountPasswordPolicy.html)) setting in `security-config.yaml`. Of equal importance is the protection of the hardware MFA devices and passwords against unauthorized disclosure. This often involves enforcing [dual authorization](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/dual_authorization), that is, one trusted individual having access to the password and a different trusted individual having access to the MFA token.
