# LZA Module Development Guide

This section contains guidance about developing and integrating LZA modules.

## Overview
Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA) modules are standalone, SDK-based code units that operate independently of the main LZA configuration files. These modules can be seamlessly integrated into the LZA framework, enhancing its capabilities and allowing for customized implementations.

Through the use of these modules, LZA capabilities can be implemented and run separately from the primary LZA deployment pipeline. This modular approach allows for greater flexibility and independent execution of specific LZA functions outside the constraints of the main pipeline process.
